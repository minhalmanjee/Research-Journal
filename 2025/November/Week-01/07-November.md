| Hybrid / Tunable         | Consistency Anchoring / Hardening      | Weakly consistent data strengthened by small metadata stored strongly.                                                                                                 | Distributed file service: large files eventually consistent, metadata linearizable.                                                     | Metadata stored linearizably                         |
| Per-Object               | Slow Memory                            | Writes from a process to each object are seen in order; no order guarantees across objects.                                                                            | Profile picture updates seen in order; other objects independent.                                                                       | Per-object PRAM                                      |
| Per-Object               | Per-Object Single Order                | For each object, all processes agree on the same total order.                                                                                                          | Each document paragraph updates appear in the same order.                                                                               | Per-object total order                               |
| Per-Object               | Per-Object Sequential Consistency      | Combines per-object single order, per-object PRAM, and correct return values.                                                                                          | Updates to different paragraphs independent but consistent per paragraph.                                                               | SingleOrder per object ∧ PerObjectPRAM ∧ RVAL(F)     |
| Per-Object               | Processor Consistency                  | Writes by a process observed in order; writes to same object seen in same order by all.                                                                                | CPU cache ensures writes to memory cells observed consistently; other cells can be reordered.                                           | PRAM + per-object single order                       |
| Per-Object               | Per-Object Linearizability             | Linearizability applied per object; operations appear instantaneous in real-time order per object.                                                                     | Bank accounts independent: each behaves atomically, independent of others.                                                              | Linearizable per object                              |
| Per-Object               | Per-Object Causal Consistency          | Causal order respected per object; independent objects are independent.                                                                                                | Editing a blog post: title edit must appear before content edit, other posts independent.                                               | hb per object ⊆ vis                                  |
