# To Do:
1. Illustrative Examples for sequential, causal and eventual consistency models.
2. Give examples when it is sequential and not eventual and vice versa for all three models.
3. Study the algorithm for all 3 models
4. Implement using Key:value database.
5. Start writing LR --> surver on consistency models, why we choose which one, performance analysis, guarantee correctness.
